            <h1>About Shanthi</h1>
            <br>
            <p>Shanthi is a young woman who has Downs Syndrome with lifelong medical problems. She has not let this inhibit her in anyway and has since the age of nine let her star shine by letting her abilities play a dominant role in the way she lives her life.</p>
            <p>She is very shy and takes a while to warm up to people. It bis when she dances, sings , plays the piano or recorder or performs in general that she sparkles.</p>
            <br>
            <p>For Shanthi Indian classical dancing is front and centre in her life. Shanthi has been a dance devotee since 9 years of age and has performed at numerous public events including:
                <p>• Harmony Day Celebrations </p>
                <p>• Navarathri celebrations Murugan Temple, Kwinana</p>
                <p>• Telugu Association of WA celebrations</p>
                <p>• Rowethorpe Aged Care Centre.</p>
                <p>• Social Inclusion Forum - Disability Services Commission.</p>
                <p>• A multicultural Festival coordinated by the Gosnells City Council</p>
                <p>• Disability Services Commission Launch of DVD - Our Voices, Our Journeys 2010</p>
                <p>• Disability Day Celebrations for National Disability Services at Burswood Ballroom Perth.</p>
                <br>

                <p>Shanthi experiences acute anxiety; she has difficulty with change, difficulty in crowds and difficulty leaving the house. The only time Shanthi ventures out and becomes an active participant in community is in the context of performing where she conquers all fear to perform to audiences of up to 500 - she is proud, professional and unflinching.</p>
                <p>This has not been an easy journey so for Shanthi. The impact of Shanthi’s daily needs and medical care has added a lot pressure on Shanthi and the family.</p>
                <p>Despite all that Shanthi goes through on a daily basis health wise, she takes great pleasure in her dancing as well as creative activities. What started out as a form of therapy has become, to all our delight and amazement, her passion that centres her.</p>
                <p>Dance is Shanthi's life, it's history and cultural significance her source of lifelong learning, it's performance the foundation of her sense of self and pride and her wish to teach - her future.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Bharathanatyam, believed to be the oldest classical dance form, originates from South India. Shanthi is required to master facial expressions, movement and an understanding of the spiritual and mythological foundations of Hinduism.</p>
                <p>For Shanthi dance,was not just about her journey but also is a critical link to - and celebration of - her cultural heritage.</p>
                <br>
                <h1>Community Participation and Inclusion</h1>
                <br>
                <p>Shanthi has always had difficulty making friends and relating to others of her age group as she has limited communication.</p>
                <p>As a result, Shanthi is often an observer and not a participant.</p>
                <p>Shanthi's immersion in dance over the last ten years has improved her confidence in ways unimaginable.</p>
                <p>Shanthi studies the stories behind the dance, even seeking to master the stories in Hindi. Her knowledge of the history has led to her greater participation in the dance classes and her teacher has commented that often she is more knowledgeable on this front than her fellow students. This has enhanced Shanthi's standing among her fellow dancers.</p>
                <p>Shanthi will be able to continue to learn under other famous dance teachers and this will create further opportunity for her to achieve her ultimate dream of teaching dance in the Bharathanatya dance schools in Australia.</p>
                <p>Dance is Shanthi's identity. She has been studying since the age of 9 years old and has no intention to stop learning not only dance but everything associated with this cultural experience.Her professional rite of passage will cement her place in the world and prove to all, that disability does not negate potential. Nor need it be a barrier to the fulfilment of ambitious dreams and aspirations.</p>




                <p>Thank you.</p>
