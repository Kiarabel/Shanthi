            <h1 class="about">Dancing</h1>
            
            <p class="text">Shanthi has always had difficulty making friends and relating to others of her age group as she has limited communication.
                As a result, Shanthi is often an observer and not a participant.
                Shanthi's immersion in dance over the last ten years has improved her confidence in ways unimaginable.
                Shanthi studies the stories behind the dance, even seeking to master the stories in Hindi. Her knowledge of the history has led to her greater participation in the dance classes and her teacher has commented that often she is more knowledgeable on this front than her fellow students. This has enhanced Shanthi's standing among her fellow dancers.
                <br>
                <br>
                Shanthi will be able to continue to learn under other famous dance teachers and this will create further opportunity for her to achieve her ultimate dream of teaching dance in the Bharathanatya dance schools in Australia.
                Dance is Shanthi's identity. She has been studying since the age of 9 years old and has no intention to stop learning not only dance but everything associated with this cultural experience.Her professional rite of passage will cement her place in the world and prove to all, that disability does not negate potential. Nor need it be a barrier to the fulfilment of ambitious dreams and aspirations.
                <br>
                <br>
                Bharathanatyam, believed to be the oldest classical dance form, originates from South India. Shanthi is required to master facial expressions, movement and an understanding of the spiritual and mythological foundations of Hinduism.
                For Shanthi, dance was not just about her journey but also is a critical link to - and celebration of - her cultural heritage.
                <br>
                <br>
